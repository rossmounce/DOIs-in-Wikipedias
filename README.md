# DOIs-in-Wikipedias
Examining DOIs cited in Wikipedias, from a data dump (Halfaker et al. 2018).

Crossref has SpringerNature DOI prefixes assigned to two different Crossref Member IDs. This is a known issue.

It turns out mining Wikipedia is a great way of finding unregistered DOIs. I'm finding some publishers have >100% of their Crossref registered DOIs cited in Wikipedia (unregistered DOIs) e.g. Virtual Worlds Institute, Inc. (Crossref member ID: 2575) has 1 DOI w/ prefix 10.4101

Wikipedia contains 2 DOIs w/ this prefix. Neither resolve or are registered with Crossref! 

10.4101/jvwr.v1i2.352 cited here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus_effect  
10.4101/jvwr.v5i1.6173 cited here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity 

Huge thanks to all the organizers of #eLifeSprint in particular whomever prepared the excellent Wikipedia citations data dump which this repo looks at. https://elifesciences.org/events/c40798c3/elife-innovation-sprint-2018 

Here's a citation for the data dump I analyse here, it's too big for normal github and I don't like LFS:

Halfaker, Aaron; Mansurov, Bahodir; redi, miriam; Taraborelli, Dario (2018): Citations with identifiers in Wikipedia. figshare. Fileset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1299540.v10
